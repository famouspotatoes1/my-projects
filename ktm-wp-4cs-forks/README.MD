## KTM/WP 4CS Motorcycle Forks
This is a project to better understand the forks on my 2016 KTM 250XC.

Suspension can most always be improved from where it is currently at, and these forks in particular, have garnered a lot of negativity in forums and so on for having a harsh behavior when going over small choppy bumps. Some suspension tuners have claims of being able to improve it, and I don't doubt this. I am just not ready to spend my money on these tune-ups that are less than quantitative; the performance improvement is all "seat of the pants".

I am setting out to gather some actual data that I will share with those who are interested on the actual dynamics of motorcycle suspension. I plan to simplify the problem as much as possible to make it comprehensible and repeatable, in case someone would like to duplicate the test setup.
